We fight the shitmonster!

Clancy immediately gets eaten by the shitmonster!

Oh, no, hang on... It actually just bit him!

Apparently it retains its hunger even when being beaten up.

We had to take care of Clancy's hit points. This was complicated!

Graf Itty jumped into the shitmonster's pile and almost puked!

In the end we defeated it with no big losses. OK, Clancy got beaten up and used to paint the wall red, but the rest seemed to be fine.

We took the dead ranger's body out of the shitmonsters pile and  to the Mushroom colony. They organized his shroomeral (get it? shroom-funeral?)

We went to Yusdrayl to say goodbye and where shown where to take a bath and where given rations, utilities and a small pouch of what appears to be magic mushrooms. (Meeks said we only should eat small pieces of these)

We left the sunless citadel with the two Humans

At the end of the first day the band camps outside. Thumboldt and Nabor trip to some shrooms. While Thumbold's mood lightened up while he was tripping he still woke up gloomy as he has been in the last days.

After the second night we saw that the black-rooted eyes on our three friends have grown.

Thurion makes a ceremony to ask his goddess what to do to help them. While he didn't really get any good answers, he got the feeling that his goddess wants him to go up-and-left. If that's on a map it would be the Sea of Tears, But it could also just have been the wind. She did kinda tell him that our friends can be saved though!

Nowhere, Itty and Thumboldt try to connect with Mondweide. Nowhere gets a vision where he thinks he can communicate with Mondweide. While he doesn't see or hear Mondweide he feels confident enough to ask her about saving our friends and finding the remaining Golthias seeds (trees). Nowhere gets the feeling that his questions have been heard by Mondweide and that she will get back to him as soon as she can (is this one of those "Don't call us we won't call you" things?)

The party breaks camp, but we haven't really decided where to yet...
